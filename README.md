# OT2 Robot Hardware Files

### Open-source & Customization Documentation

Opentrons strives to make all of our technology as open to customization and extension as possible. In addition to providing all of our code in open-source repositories and developing all of our software in a transparent way, we are providing these hardware files for our community to modify their OT-2 robots however they choose.

Included are:
- PCB design files for the key electrical boards in the robot, including our version of the smoothieboard (smoothieware.org) motor controller board
- Electrical schematic of robotic wiring and pin-outs
- DXF file for the OT-2 deck showing exact dimensions of the removable deck and slots
- Scale models of the full robot with all the dimensions needed to design hardware integrated with OT-2

If there are files missing that you need to do your work, please reach out to info@opentrons.com and we will be happy to discuss how we can provide you with what you require. We love hearing from our community!

Thanks,

The Opentrons Team
